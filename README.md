# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Heart failure remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and risk
assessment play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project aims to utilize machine
learning techniques to predict heart failure risk by analysing and modelling the Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset. The dataset contains clinical and demographic features such as age, cholesterol levels, resting
blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved, and a target variable indicating the presence of heart
disease.
